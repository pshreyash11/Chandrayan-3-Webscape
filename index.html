                        Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft
                        entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down near the Lunar south pole[8] on 23
                        August at 18:03 IST (12:33 UTC), making India the fourth country to successfully land on the
                        Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar south pole.[9][note 1] On 3 September the lander
                        hopped and repositioned itself 30–40 cm (12–16 in) from its landing site.[13] After the
                        completion of its mission objectives, it was hoped that the lander and rover would revive for
                        extra tasks, on 22 September 2023, but missed the wake-up call. On September 30, the second
                        lunar night began, eliminating hopes of revival

                    <p>
                        The lunar south pole region holds particular interest for scientific exploration. Studies show
                        large amounts of ice there. Mountainous terrain and unpredictable lighting protect the ice from
                        melting, but they also make landing scientific probes there a challenging undertaking. The ice
                        could contain solid-state compounds that would normally melt under warmer conditions elsewhere
                        on the Moon—compounds which could provide insight into lunar, Earth, and Solar System history.
                        For future crewed missions and outposts, ice could also be a source of drinking water and of
                        hydrogen for fuel and oxygen

                        On 3 September, the rover was put into sleep mode after it had completed all of its assignments.
                        Its batteries were charged and receiver left on, according to ISRO, in preparation for the
                        impending lunar night.[56] "The rover's payloads are turned off and the data it collected has
                        been transmitted to Earth via the lander", the statement said. Chandrayaan-3's lander and rover
                        were expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, or 14 Earth days, and the on-board
                        electronics were not designed to withstand the −120 °C (−184 °F) nighttime temperatures on the
                        Moon.[57] On 22 September, the lander and rover missed their wake-up calls,[58][59] and by 28
                        September neither had responded, diminishing hopes for further surface operations
